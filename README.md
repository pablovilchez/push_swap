## Description

Push_swap is a project from 42 School that involves sorting algorithms in C. The goal of this project is to implement an efficient sorting algorithm to order a stack of integers using a limited set of operations.

## Features

- Sorting of integers using various algorithms.
- Operations include swapping, pushing elements between stacks, and rotating stacks.
- Visualization of sorting operations.
- Optimization techniques to minimize the number of operations.

## Requirements

- Unix-based operating system (Linux or macOS)
- GCC compiler

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/pablovilchez/42-push_swap.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```sh
    cd push_swap
    ```

3. Compile the project:

    ```sh
    make
    ```

## Usage

Run the program by executing the following command:

```sh
./push_swap [list of integers]
```
